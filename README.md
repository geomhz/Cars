```

To start the system with the command:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open a browser and navigate locally:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

View the list of available cars without having access to edits:
NOTE: By clicking on any car image from the available list, you will have access to the car's details.
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/cars/
```

Sign-up in the system to gain access to CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE):
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/register/
```

Log in to access the system:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/
```

After logging in with the new account created, you will have access to car edits by clicking on the image of any car.
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000/cars/
```

Register a new car. The upload images will be automatically added to the "media" folder located at the root of the project!
```bash

```

There you go! Now that you know how to navigate the system, you can start exploring!!
